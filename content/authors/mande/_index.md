I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Algorithms and Complexity Group at CWI, hosted by Ronald de Wolf. Before this, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University, where I was hosted by Justin Thaler.

Before that, I was a research scholar in the School of Technology and Computer Science at TIFR Mumbai, where Arkadev Chattopadhyay was my advisor.
