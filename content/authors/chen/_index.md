I am Yanlin Chen (陳彥霖) from Taiwan, a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. Ronald de Wolf and Prof. Māris Ozols at Algorithm and Complexity group, CWI, the Netherlands. I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and a Master's degree in Computer Science division of Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in July 2016.

My research interests are theoretical computer science, quantum computation, and in particular, quantum algorithms for lattice problems and for optimization. I am enthralled by convex and non-convex optimization, the supremacy of quantum computation, and high dimensional geometry. Currently, I am working on constructing more efficient quantum algorithms for convex optimization problems and lattice problems.

Outside academics, I am an amateur magician. I perform magic shows and was the supervisor of the magic club of National Taiwan University. I also play soccer, design games.
