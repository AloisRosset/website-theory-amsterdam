The Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics (KdVI) at the University of Amsterdam and the Gravitation programme NETWORKS invite applications for a tenured position as Assistant Professor in Discrete Mathematics or closely related area.

Preference will be given to candidates who have demonstrated capacities in research and have a strong research program well-aligned with the NETWORKS-programme and the research interests of the Discrete Mathematics and Quantum Information (DMQI) group at KdVI.

Our intent is to attract top talent from all over the world, ambitious and motivated scientists who will forward our goal of having a maximal impact on science and society. We offer a stimulating environment and excellent conditions for research, tightly connected to challenging educational programmes.

### Research area
The position is in the DMQI group at KdVI and in the context of the NETWORKS programme. More information about DMQI group can be found [here](https://kdvi.uva.nl/research/discrete-mathematics-and-quantum-information/discrete-mathematics-and-quantum-information.html) and about the NETWORKS programme can be found [here](https://www.thenetworkcenter.nl/).


Recently substantial investments in discrete mathematics and quantum information have been made at KdVI, with the appointments of several new staff members. We are now searching for an outstanding candidate to further develop our currently strong position in this area.


The DMQI programme joins two research areas, giving rise to a friendly research community with rich collaboration opportunities. The group’s work in discrete mathematics centers on extremal and probabilistic combinatorics and graph theory, algebraic and topological graph theory, and computational complexity, with applications in the sciences, especially physics. The quantum information side focuses on the mathematics of quantum computing and quantum information processing. The program is tied together by the deep connections between discrete structures, algebraic methods in discrete math and quantum information, and the work of several group members bridges both fields. The discrete mathematics research of the group is particularly unified by a shared interest in graph polynomials and their applications.


Discrete mathematics and combinatorial optimization play a pivotal role in the NETWORKS programme since one of the key ambitions of the NETWORKS programme is to develop algorithms and techniques for networks in an inherently stochastic and dynamic context, so as to address real world network problems ranging from air traffic control to understanding the human brain.


The DMQI group also interfaces with [QuSoft](https://qusoft.org), the the Dutch research Centre for Quantum Software, that explores and develops uses of quantum computers and other quantum technologies for the benefit of society. Furthermore, there are strong ties with related groups in the Netherlands through the national research cluster DIAMANT. Regarding education (both at the master and PhD level) there is a close connection with LNMB (the national network for the mathematics of operations research) and Mastermath. Discrete mathematics and quantum information are popular topics among students at the University of Amsterdam.


## What are you going to do?
You are expected to:
- carry out active research in DMQI group, publish in high-level international journals, present your work at leading conferences and supervise PhD students;
- take responsibility for and take part in teaching efforts of our programmes in discrete mathematics and quantum information, including supervision of undergraduate and graduate students, and teach in the national master programme;
- engage with the research and organizational activities of the NETWORKS programme;
- be active in attracting external funding;
- be open to collaborations with other institutes and/or companies, and to joint research projects both within and beyond KdVI;
- participate in the valorisation of mathematical research.

## What do we require of you?
- A PhD in mathematics or closely related field, with experience with and affinity for research areas closely aligned with the interests of the DMQI group;
- a strong research vision and a track record of engagement within your department and across the wider mathematical or scientific community;
- the ability and capacity to develop independent and vigorous programmes of funded research;
- a keen interest in pursuing excellence in teaching and in supervising undergraduate and graduate students, witnessed by positive evaluations and recommendations;
- fluency in English, both written and spoken;
- the ability to teach in Dutch or the willingness to learn Dutch;
- the willingness to acquire the university teaching qualification (BKO) required by Dutch universities.


For consideration at the senior level, we also expect:
- an encouraging leadership style and a network towards engagement within your department and across the wider mathematical or scientific community;
- a high visibility in the mathematical community through conference organizing, invited talks at leading conferences and other recognitions;
- experience in organizational and administrative skills;
- substantive and successful mentoring experience;
- an excellent track record of publications and research grant acquisition.


## Our offer
The preferred starting date is 1 September 2022. The position will be filled at the level of Assistant Professor. We offer a temporary contract for 18 months. Following a positive assessment, the appointment will become permanent.

The starting salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel, and depending on experience and qualifications. It will range from a minimum of €3,821 gross per month up to a maximum of €5,943 gross per month (salary scale 11-12) based on full-time employment.

Additionally you’ll be given 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The [Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities](https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/cao-universiteiten.html) is applicable.
