I am Assistant Professor in Theoretical Computer Science at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam. My main research interest is Modal Logic, both from a theoretical perspective and with its applications for multi-agent systems, in particular Dynamic Epistemic Logic. A specific setting I have worked on are Gossip Protocols. I am also teaching courses in Functional Programming and have an interest in using proof assistants to verify results in Modal Logic.
