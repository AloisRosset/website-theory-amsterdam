As a PhD student under the supervision of Harry Buhrman, I conduct research towards the development of new quantum algorithms, with a particular focus on algorithms that are executable in the near term. Together with Harry Buhrman and Niels Neumann, we examine the capabilities of constant-depth quantum circuits empowered by fast classical feedforward.

I also work on Quantum Complexity theory, with a particular focus on Hamiltonian complexity, together with Chris Cade and Jordi Weggemans. We look at alternate versions of the Local-Hamiltonian problem, which in it original from is well-known to be QMA-Complete, that allow us to study the class QCMA. In particular, we study the possibility of a PCP theorem for QCMA.

Besides research, I am involved with the "Quantum in Business and Society" course at the UvA. I also worked on projects involving companies that are interested in the developing field of quantum computing. We discussed the problems the companies face and how quantum computing could be used to solve them.
