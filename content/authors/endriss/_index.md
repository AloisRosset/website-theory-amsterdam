I'm Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Collective Decision Making at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam, where I lead the COMSOC Group. My research concerns the use of formal methods in AI, specifically in multiagent systems and knowledge representation. I'm particularly interested in problems at the interface of AI with economics and political science, and much of my work in this area falls under the heading of computational social choice.

Specific research topics in this domain I have contributed to include preference modelling, voting theory, judgment aggregation, fair division, negotiation, and auction design. I have also worked on agent communication languages, formal models of argumentation, automated reasoning, abduction, modal and temporal logics, and software tools for teaching logic. All of my papers are available from this website. Most of them are also open-access publications in the formal sense of that term (and hopefully one day all of them will be).

I regularly teach courses on Computational Social Choice and Game Theory for our MSc Logic and MSc AI programmes, as well as (less regularly) a course on Problem Solving and Search for the first-year students in our BSc AI programme. I make a point of making all of the teaching materials I developed over the years openly available to everyone who might be interested (just as I do for my research output).
