### Job Description
You will work on the project entitled “Counting colorings using complex dynamics”. We are looking for an enthusiastic and motivated applicant with a good background in graph theory, theoretical computer science or complex dynamical systems. In particular, some knowledge of graph polynomials and partition functions will be appreciated.  The project is centered around determining the location of the complex zeros of the partition function of the Potts model on bounded degree graphs using techniques from complex dynamical system, combinatorics and statistical physics.
