## Job Description
The candidate will be expected to perform independent research and publish in high quality conferences and journals. There are no teaching obligations at CWI, though the candidate may be asked to help with the organization of reading groups and seminars.

The research will be supported by the ERC grant "Towards a Quantitative Theory of Integer Programming". A principal goal of this project is to develop a theory capable of explaining the performance of the many techniques used to solve integer programs, such branch & bound, cutting planes, fast LP solving and rounding heuristics. Complementary to this goal, the project aims to make progress on related fundamental open problems in the context of LP, IP and discrepancy theory. For more information, please visit the project website: https://homepages.cwi.nl/~dadush/erc/erc.html.

The candidate will be expected to help advance the goals of the project together with their own personal research agenda.
