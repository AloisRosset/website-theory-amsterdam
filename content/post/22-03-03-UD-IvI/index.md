Are you enthusiastic about quantum information science and are you equally passionate about research and education in this field? Are you looking forward to taking the next step in your career and are you excited about joining one of the world-leading places in quantum research? The Informatics Institute (IvI) at the University of Amsterdam is seeking to significantly strengthen its quantum profile by appointing a new faculty member in this area on the level of assistant professor (UD).
<!--more-->

The candidate will be embedded in the Theory of Computer Science (TCS) group at IvI and should have a research profile in quantum information science that aligns with research at QuSoft, the Dutch research centre for quantum software, and which allows to connect with the expertise of other research groups at the institute. For example, in:
* *machine learning and AI*, to explore whether quantum information and computation can improve existing techniques in AI, or offer new possibilities going beyond the non-quantum state-of-the art;
* *complex systems*, to use quantum computers to simulate the quantum processes that underly many complex systems in biology, material science or chemistry;
* *networks and security*, to explore the role of quantum information with respect to networks, security, distributed/parallel computation, e.g. in post-quantum cryptography, quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution, quantum internet, distributed and delegated quantum computation, etc.

Supported by Action Line 3 of QDNL, the UvA is planning to set up a new two-year research MSc program in Quantum Computer Science. The candidate will be the scientific leader of this new programme. Setting up an entirely new MSc program from scratch is a rare and exciting chance for long-lasting educational impact. The candidate will play a crucial role representing the UvA efforts in the new Quantum.Amsterdam Talent & Learning Center.

## What are you going to do?
As a faculty member at the Informatics Institute, you will contribute to all aspects of the institute’s scientific mission, considering the normal research:teaching ratio of 70:30 at the institute. This includes in particular:
- Research: develop your own independent research line; building and coordinating a research team of PhD candidates and postdocs; publishing your work in recognised outlets; and supporting your research through the acquisition of funding from agencies such as the NWO and ERC, and possibly industrial partners.
- Teaching (30% of the position’s total time): (co-)supervise the group’s postdocs, PhD students and MSc students; teach one course in the new MSc program Quantum CS; scientific coordination of the new program.
- Knowledge transfer: contribute to outreach, both in terms of engaging with (inter)national academic partners as well as possible industrial partners.
- Management: contributing to management and administrative tasks at the institute, related to both education and research.

## What do we require of you?
Your experience and profile:
- a PhD degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics or closely related field;
- excellent research skills in quantum information science, as evidenced by a track record of publications in renowned conference proceedings and journals;
- ability to promote outstanding and innovative research and foster research collaborations (with faculty, postdoctoral researchers and PhD candidates);
- a track record and affinity for teaching and supervision (at the undergraduate and graduate levels),  with willingness to acquire a certificate of academic teaching quality (e.g. Dutch BKO) within two years;
- the ability to communicate research findings to a broad audience;
- willingness and ability to perform relevant administrative and organisational tasks, in particular related to educational tasks;
- international research experience is preferred as is a highly collaborative and enthusiastic approach;
- an excellent command of English and willingness to learn the Dutch language.

## Our offer
We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 18 months with a probationary period of two months. Preferred starting date is between 1 August and 1 September 2022. A permanent contract follows if we assess your performance positive.

The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be €3,821 to €5,230 gross per month (scale 11), based on a fulltime contract (38 hours a week). This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The [Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities](https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/cao-universiteiten.html) is applicable.
