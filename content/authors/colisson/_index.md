I am a postdoc in quantum cryptography at QuSoft, the Dutch research center for quantum software and at CWI, the Center of Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm supervised by Stacey Jeffery, Christian Schaffner and Florian Speelman. Before that, I did my PhD in Paris (LIP6, Sorbonne University) with Elham Kashefi and Antoine Joux.
