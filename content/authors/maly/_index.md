I am currently pursuing my project "A holistic analysis of participatory budgeting" for which I was granted a Erwin Schr√∂dinger Fellowship by the FWF. In this project, I want to explore Participatory Budgeting not as an isolated voting instance, but as a multi-year, city-wide process that consists of several stages.

Apart from that, I work mainly in the fields of Computational Social Choice, Logic and Knowledge Representation. In general, I am interested in studying and developing tools that help people make better decision, individually or as a group. In particular, I currently work on non-standard voting frameworks such as Participatory Budgeting and Perpetual Voting, on the representation of preferences, and on computational complexity questions that arise in COMSOC and logic.
