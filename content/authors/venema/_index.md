With a first degree in mathematics (Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, 1987) and a PhD in Logic (Universiteit van Amsterdam, 1992), I think of myself as a mathematical logician, with an interest in applications of logic in theoretical computer science. I am working as a full professor at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the Universiteit van Amsterdam.
