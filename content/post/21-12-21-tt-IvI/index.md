Do you have the ambition to carry out top academic research in Theoretical Computer Science at the Institute for Informatics (IvI)? Do you have a solid background in algorithms and complexity theory and you would like to establish connections to research lines in neighboring disciplines? Are you interested in joining and building a growing community of TCS researchers in Amsterdam?  Do you have the drive to teach theoretical computer science in our Bachelor/Master programs?
<!--more-->


The University of Amsterdam (UvA) is hiring a tenure-track researcher for their theory of computer science group at the Institute for Informatics (IvI). You will be able to hire a PhD student as part of the startup-package.



You are expected to do world-leading research in theoretical computer science with a preference for research areas that are complementary to the already existing expertise in quantum computing and cryptography. Examples include (classical) algorithms and complexity theory. Interest in collaborating with researchers from theory and other IvI research groups (e.g. in AI, Data Science, Computational Science, Systems & Networking) is considered a plus.



You will be joining a growing and vibrant team of colleagues in Amsterdam all working in theoretical computer science from various UvA institutes such as IvI, the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC), the mathematics institute (KdVI), but also CWI and the VU. See https://theory.amsterdam/ for an overview.


*Applicants looking for a faculty position at the Associate/Full Professor level might also be interested in the current openings in the [Theoretical Computer Science Group at the neighbouring Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)](https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/job/Faculty-Positions-in-Theoretical-Computer-Science/737826402/).*


## What are you going to do?
You are expected to
- contribute to the development of the Amsterdam theory group through innovative research and develop your own independent research line;
- acquire independent funding from sources such as the national funding agency NWO (e.g. VIDI), EU funding via H2020 (e.g. ERC starting grant) and possibly industry.
- (co-)supervise the group’s postdocs, PhD students and MSc students;
- contribute to strengthening the curriculum in TCS of the Bachelor and Master Computer Science and related programmes; teaching is 30% of the position’s total time;
- contribute to outreach, both in terms of engaging with (inter)national academic partners as well as possible industrial partners.

## What do we require of you?
- A PhD degree in (Theoretical) Computer Science, Mathematics or closely related field.
- A solid publication record in theoretical computer science as demonstrated by international peer reviewed publications at top-tier conferences (FOCS, STOC, CCC, ICALP, SODA, ESA etc.) or in relevant journals.
- Experience in obtaining research funding in an ambitious environment.
- Inspirational teaching skills and affinity for teaching and supervision (at the undergraduate and graduate levels),  with willingness to acquire a certificate of academic teaching quality (e.g. Dutch BKO) within two years.
- Ability to promote excellent and innovative research and foster research collaborations (with faculty, postdoctoral researchers and PhD candidates).
- At least two years of postdoctoral experience is expected but not strictly necessary. International research experience is also preferred.

## Our offer
We offer a temporary employment contract with a tenure track agreement for the duration of five years. You will be offered a permanent position after positive assessment and evaluation. The type of contract is negotiable and depends on experience and scientific profile of the selected candidate. The committee will make an offer pending the vacancy and your experience and track record. The starting salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel, and depending on experience and qualifications.

The gross monthly salary based on full-time employment (38 hours per week) ranges from €3,821 up to a maximum of €5,943 (salary scale 11/12). This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8,3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants.  The profile Assistant Professor is applicable in accordance with the [Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/cao).
