Are you working at the forefront of theoretical computer science and are you equally passionate about research and teaching in this field? Are you looking forward to taking the next step in your career and are you excited about joining a renowned interdisciplinary research institute with a strong international orientation?
<!--more-->


The [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) is seeking to significantly strengthen its profile in the domain of theoretical computer science by appointing two new faculty members in this area. One appointment will be made at either the Full Professor or the Associate Professor level, and another at either the Associate Professor or the Assistant Professor level.

We will consider applications from individuals working in any area of specialisation within theoretical computer science, including both areas already represented at the institute and areas that would naturally complement its current profile. We expect that one (but not both) of the appointments will be made in an area of specialisation that aligns with research at [QuSoft](https://qusoft.org/), the Dutch research centre for quantum software.

At the ILLC we strive for a better gender balance amongst our staff. We therefore strongly encourage women to apply for these positions.

*Applicants looking for a tenure-track position at the Assistant Professor level might also be interested in the current opening in the [Theoretical Computer Science Group at the neighbouring Informatics Institute](https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/job/Tenure-Track-Position-in-Theoretical-Computer-Science/737970202/).*


## What are you going to do?
As a faculty member at the ILLC you will contribute to all aspects of the institute’s scientific mission, taking into account the normal research:teaching ratio of 60:40 at the ILLC.

This includes, in particular:
- Research:
  * developing an independent line of research; building and coordinating a research team of PhD candidates and postdocs; publishing your work in recognised outlets; and supporting your research through the acquisition of funding from agencies such as the NWO and ERC, and possibly industrial partners;
- Teaching:
  * designing and teaching courses in Computer Science and AI in programmes such as the BSc and MSc Computer Science, the BSc and MSc Artificial Intelligence, and the MSc Logic; and supervising students at both the Bachelor’s and the Master’s level;
- Knowledge transfer:
  * engaging in outreach activities directed at the general public; and, where possible, seeking cooperation with partner organisations in the private and the public sector.
- Professional service:
  * contributing to the proper functioning of the international scientific community through peer review, serving on relevant editorial boards and programme committees, as well as other relevant activities.
- Management:
  * contributing to management and administrative tasks at the institute, related to both education and research.

The extent of your involvement in each of these activities will depend on your level of seniority (Assistant/Associate/Full Professor).


## What do we require of you?
We are looking for outstanding academics, with a strong track record in research (relative to the level of seniority of the applicant) and a true dedication to first-class teaching.



In particular, we require:
- a PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related discipline;
- a strong track record of publications in renowned conference proceedings or journals;
- a track record of successfully supervising PhD candidates (for Associate/Full Professor);
- teaching experience at university level and demonstrable didactic abilities;
- experience with and commitment to supervising and mentoring students;
- willingness to acquire the Dutch Basic Teaching Qualification for academic staff (BKO) within two years of your appointment;
- a proven track record of attracting research funding from a variety of sources (for Associate/Full Professor);
- an extensive international network of research contacts (for Associate/Full Professor);
- the ability to communicate research findings to a broad audience;
- excellent managerial and leadership qualities (for Full Professor);
- willingness and ability to perform relevant administrative and organisational tasks;
- team spirit and a strong affinity with the ILLC’s interdisciplinary environment;
- an excellent command of the English language and willingness to learn Dutch.


## Our offer
We offer a temporary employment contract for a period of two years, with the intention of converting it into a permanent contract after a positive assessment.

The gross monthly salary depends on relevant prior experience and will range for an Assistant Professor from €3,807 to €5,211 (scale 11/12), for an Associate Professor from €5,275 to €7,054 (scale 13/14), and for a Full Professor from €6,510 to €10,272 (scale 16/18).

These figures apply in case you opt for a full-time contract of 38 hours per week (part-time arrangements of 0.8fte are possible as well). The annual salary will be supplemented with an 8% holiday allowance and an 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the so-called ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The [Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en_GB/cao-universiteiten.html) applies.

In case of appointment as Full Professor, there furthermore is funding available for a four-year PhD position.

The starting date is negotiable, but preferably will be on or around 1 September 2022.
