I am a senior researcher in the Algorithms and Complexity group at CWI and am part of the Networks center and QuSoft.

My research is on various topics in computational complexity theory, quantum information theory and discrete mathematics. A unifying theme in my work is the interaction between amortization, symmetry and approximation.
