Mathematician and computer scientist working as an assistant professor at the [Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.zuiddam/kdvi.uva.nl) of the [University of Amsterdam](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.zuiddam/uva.nl).

From 2020 to 2021 I was a [Simons Junior Fellow](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/) at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.courant.nyu.edu/) of New York University, hosted by Oded Regev. From 2018 to 2020 I was a member in the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, hosted by Avi Wigderson. Until 2018 I worked at CWI, the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands. I received my PhD cum laude from the University of Amsterdam in October 2018.
