I am PhD candidate under the supervision of Ulle Endriss and Ronald de Haan at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam in (surprisingly) Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

My research interests lie mainly at the intersection of Economics and Computer Science. The main area I have been working on is Computational Social Choice, a field of research interested in analyzing social choice through the lens of theoretical computer science.
I am also particularly interested in the logical analysis of interaction between agents, as in abstract argumentation for instance.
