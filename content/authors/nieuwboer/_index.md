I’m a PhD student at the Korteweg-de Vries Institute and QuSoft at the University of Amsterdam, and an affiliated researcher at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, advised by prof. dr. Michael Walter and prof. dr. Eric Opdam. My office is located at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica.

I’m interested in classical and quantum algorithms for optimization problems with a lot of geometric or algebraic structure, such as (geodesic) convexity or having many symmetries. In particular, I have worked on scaling problems, such as matrix scaling, operator scaling and tensor scaling. These problems have connections to representation theory, geometric invariant theory, quantum information theory, quantum many-body physics, machine learning, statistics, and numerical linear algebra.
