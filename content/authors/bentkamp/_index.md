I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Theoretical Computer Science section of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands. My main research interests are automated and interactive theorem proving. I am part of the Matryoshka project, where I work on a superposition calculus for higher-order logic. I have a PhD in computer science from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Before my PhD, I studied mathematics and computational linguistics.
