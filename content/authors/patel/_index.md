I am assistant professor at the Korteweg - de Vries Institute for Mathematics at the University of Amsterdam. I joined the institute in May 2015. Before that I was a postdoc at QMUL, University of Birmingham, and University of Durham all in the UK. I did my PhD at the London School of Economics.

My general area of interest is combinatorics and graph theory. In particular, I am interested in extremal combinatorics, the probabilistic method, Ramsey Theory, posets, algorithms, computational counting and zeros of partition functions.
