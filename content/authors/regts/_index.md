Currently, I am an associate professor at the Korteweg de Vries Institute for Mathematics at the University of Amsterdam.

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2013 under supervision of Lex Schrijver. The title of my Ph.D. thesis is: `Graph Parameters and Invariants of the Orthogonal Group'.

My research interests are: graph polynomials and partition functions, graph limits, extremal combinatorics and their links to algebra, algorithms, analysis and other areas of mathematics.
