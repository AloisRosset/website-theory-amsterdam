I am a researcher at the Algorithms and Complexity group of CWI (Dutch Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science) and part-time full professor at the ILLC of the University of Amsterdam. I'm also a member of QuSoft. A long time ago I was a PhD student at CWI and ILLC, and then a postdoc at UC Berkeley.
