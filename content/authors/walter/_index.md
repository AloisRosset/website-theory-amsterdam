From 2017 to 2021, Michael Walter was assistant professor in mathematics and theoretical physics at the University of Amsterdam (KdVI, ITFA, ILLC) and QuSoft. Before that he was a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University. He received his PhD from ETH Zurich in October 2014. Since 2022, Michael is a full professor and chair of the quantum information group at the Faculty of Computer Science, Ruhr-University Bochum, and the CASA Cluster of Excellence, and a guest professor at UvA.

His research is in quantum information and computation, and their interplay with other branches of computer science, mathematics, and theoretical physics. Motivated by quantum information, he also studies problems in optimization, representation theory, and invariant theory through the lens of computation. He is a 2017 Veni laureate and received a 2020 Early Career Award from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). He is currently supported by an NWO OC ENW grant and is part of the BMBF consortium project QuBRA.
