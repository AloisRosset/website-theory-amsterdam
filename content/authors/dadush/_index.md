I am currently a tenured researcher at CWI in the Networks & Optimization group. Previously, I was a Simons Postdoctoral Fellow for 2 years at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. I completed my PhD in 2012 within the ACO (Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization) program at Georgia Tech under Santosh Vempala (Professor of Computer Science).
