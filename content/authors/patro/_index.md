I am a PhD student in the Algorithms and Complexity Group at QuSoft, CWI supervised by Harry Buhrman and Florian Speelman. I am broadly interested in the area of quantum computational complexity theory. More specifically, in quantum fine-grained complexity. In addition to that, I am also interested in classical decision tree complexity and quantum query complexity of Boolean relations, and the connections between them.
