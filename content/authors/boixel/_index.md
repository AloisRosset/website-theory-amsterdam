I'm a PhD candidate at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) under the supervision of Ulle Endriss.

I'm interested in seeing how computer-aided methods from various fields (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Constraint Programming, Logic Programming, etc.) can help solving Social Choice related problems.
