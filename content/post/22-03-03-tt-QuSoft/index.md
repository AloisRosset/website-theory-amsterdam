QuSoft is the Dutch research Center for Quantum Software and Technology, a joint collaboration between the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI). Our mission is to explore and develop uses of quantum computers and other quantum technologies, for the benefit of society. Our researchers develop algorithms, protocols, software and applications that exploit the extraordinary power of quantum computers based on their quantum mechanical properties, such as superposition, interference and entanglement. That requires fundamentally different techniques and approaches from those used to develop conventional software.



About 70 people are involved in QuSoft and we are continuously growing. We are an interdisciplinary research center, involving researchers from CWI and four institutes at UvA:
the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Logic, Language and Computation, the Informatics Institute, and the Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics.



The research is performed along five research lines:
1. Quantum simulation and few-qubit applications,
2. Quantum information science,
3. Cryptography in a quantum world,
4. Quantum algorithms and complexity,
5. Quantum for society and business.

## What are you going to do

We are looking for candidates who can strengthen one of the QuSoft research lines mentioned above, but welcome applications with a solid background in the broader area of quantum information theory. You will be part of the QuSoft faculty and take on an active role in shaping and developing the center – in the longer term building up towards a leading role within QuSoft. You are also expected to become actively involved with the innovation activities in the Quantum.Amsterdam hub.

You will be teaching in the relevant Bachelor and Master programs within the UvA – first and foremost in specialized courses in the QuSoft subject area, but also in the wider context of the educational programs in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics at the UvA’s Faculty of Science.

You will be employed by UvA – embedded in one of the four institutes involved depending on your field of expertise and your future research area of interest. You will spend most of your research time at the QuSoft center, which is presently hosted by CWI.

*If you are looking for an assistant professorship in quantum information science you might also be interested in the current opening advertised: [Assistant Professorship in Quantum Information Science](https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/job/ivi/742510202/).*


## What do we require
You have a research interest and strong track record in the field of quantum information, preferably connecting to one of the five research lines.
* You hold a PhD degree in Physics, Mathematics or Computer Science and have a demonstrable commitment to teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
* You are keen to fostering collaborations not only within Amsterdam's academic institutes, but also nationally and internationally, and with external partners and in some cases industrial partners.
* Most importantly, you have the ability and capacity to develop independent and vigorous programs of funded research.
* You are expected to acquire a university teaching qualification (UTQ) as demanded by Dutch universities.
* International research experience is preferred as is a highly collaborative and enthusiastic approach.

## Our offer
Start dates are negotiable. The positions will be filled at the level of Assistant or Associate Professor, depending on qualifications. In case of Assistant Professor we in principle offer you a tenure-track agreement for five years (which is part of a six-year temporary appointment). At the start, we will draw up an agreement with you, specifying the tenure-track requirements for research, teaching and management tasks that need to be fulfilled in order to assess progress after three years and after five years. The requirements in this agreement are negotiable and depend on your experience and scientific profile. Following a positive assessment after five years the appointment will become permanent.

In case of Associate Professor, we offer you a tenured position with a probation period of 18 months. The starting salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and depending on experience and qualifications. It will range from a minimum of €3,821 gross per month up to a maximum of €7,079 gross per month (salary scale 11-14) based on full-time employment.

This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The collective labour agreement [Dutch Universities](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/cao) is applicable.

Are you curious about our extensive package of secondary employment benefits like our excellent opportunities for study and development? Take a look [here](https://www.uva.nl/en/faculty/faculty-of-science/working-at-the-faculty/working-at-the-faculty-of-science.html).

In both cases the position comes with a generous startup package.
