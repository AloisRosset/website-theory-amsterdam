I am currently an assistant professor in Discrete Mathematics at the Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics, at University of Amsterdam.

From October 2019 to August 2020, I was a post-doctoral fellow at Université de Montréal and Centre de Recherches Mathématiques, supervised by Luc Vinet.  From September 2017 to August 2019, I was a post-doctoral fellow at Université libre de Bruxelles with Samuel Fiorini. I was a visiting scholar at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley, from September 1 to November 1, 2017.  From September 2015 to August 2017, I was a post-doc at University of Waterloo with Chris Godsil. My main area of interest is algebraic graph theory. In particular, my background is in eigenvalues of graphs and digraphs, graph polynomials, association schemes, and linear algebra. I am interested in studying these areas, but also in using tools from these areas in new settings, such as quantum computing and optimization.

I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at Simon Fraser University on (2011 – January 26, 2015) under the supervision of Bojan Mohar. The title of my thesis is “Simple eigenvalues of graphs and digraphs”.
