I am a PhD student on the Lean Forward project under the supervision of Jasmin Blanchette and Sander Dahmen. My research interests lie in the intersection of computing science and mathematics, in a gradient from (intuitionistic) logic, type theory, formal verification to functional programming. Previously, I completed double majors in Computing Science and Mathematics at Utrecht University for my Bachelor and Master. I am active in sustainable ecology, LGBT+ rights and software freedom.
