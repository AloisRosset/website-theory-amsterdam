Are you an ambitious researcher with a PhD degree in Mathematics, Computer Science, or Physics, strong mathematical background, and expertise in quantum computing and quantum algorithms?

<!--more-->

QuSoft is looking for a postdoctoral researcher for developing and analyzing new quantum algorithms. This position is part of Maris Ozols VIDI project “Mathematics of Quantum Algorithms”, funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO). The goal of this project is to develop quantum algorithms for algebraic problems, as well as for problems where both the input and output are quantum states as opposed to classical bit strings. More specifically, we will focus on designing new quantum transforms and subroutines. We will look for new ways to attack algebraic problems using ideas from Hadamard matrix theory, and use tools from representation theory to extend the quantum Schur transform and apply it to problems with permutational and/or unitary symmetries. You will also have an opportunity to collaborate with other members of QuSoft.

## What are you going to do?
You will be expected to fulfill the following tasks:

- collaborate with me and my PhD students;
- assist with the supervision of my PhD and MSc students;
- regularly present research results at international workshops and conferences, and publish them in conference proceedings and journals;
- participate in and contribute to the organisation of research activities and events at both QuSoft and ILLC, such as workshops and colloquia.

While this is primarily a research position, you will have the opportunity to contribute to teaching activities.

## What to require of you?
You have:
- a PhD degree in Mathematics, Computer Science, or Physics;
- a strong background in quantum computing and quantum algorithms, as witnessed by talks and publications in leading conferences and journals;
- in-depth knowledge of representation theory, abstract algebra, or combinatorics will be considered as an advantage;
- a strong passion for research and for exploring new areas of mathematics, and the wish to develop new skills through working with or assisting in guiding PhD and MSc students;
- excellent communication skills in English, both oral and written.

## Our offer
A temporary contract for 38 hours a week, preferably starting in September 2021. You will be given an initial contract for a probation period of one year. On positive evaluation, your contract will be extended for a further year.

The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be between €2,790 to €4,402 gross per month, based on a fulltime contract (38 hours a week). This is exclusive of 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.
