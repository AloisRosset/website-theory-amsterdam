## Adriaan van Wijngaarden
from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriaan_van_Wijngaarden):
<img src="wijngaarden.jpg" style="width:20%;padding:10px;float:left;display:block"></img>
Adriaan "Aad" van Wijngaarden (2 November 1916 – 7 February 1987) was a Dutch mathematician and computer scientist. Trained as an engineer, Van Wijngaarden would emphasize and promote the mathematical aspects of computing, first in numerical analysis, then in programming languages and finally in design principles of such languages.

Van Wijngaarden was intrigued by the new idea of automatic computing. On 1 January 1947, he became the head of the Computing Department of the brand-new Mathematisch Centrum (MC) in Amsterdam. He then made further visits to England and the United States, gathering ideas for the construction of the first Dutch computer, the ARRA, an electromechanical device first demonstrated in 1952. In that same year, Van Wijngaarden hired Edsger Dijkstra, and they worked on software for the ARRA.

<img src="dijkstra.jpg" style="width:20%;padding:10px;float:left;display:block"></img>
Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (11 May 1930 – 6 August 2002) was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, systems scientist, science essayist, and pioneer in computing science. A theoretical physicist by training, he worked as a programmer at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam) from 1952 to 1962. A university professor for much of his life, Dijkstra held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin from 1984 until his retirement in 1999. He was a professor of mathematics at the Eindhoven University of Technology (1962–1984) and a research fellow at the Burroughs Corporation (1973–1984). In 1972, he became the first person who was neither American nor British to win the Turing Award.

<img src="debakker.jpg" style="width:20%;padding:10px;float:left;display:block"></img>
Jacobus Willem (Jaco) de Bakker (Ede, 7 maart 1939 – Amsterdam, 13 december 2012) was een Nederlands theoretisch informaticus en hoogleraar aan de Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

De Bakker studeerde wiskunde aan de Vrije Universiteit en de Universiteit van Amsterdam. Bij die laatste promoveerde hij in 1967 onder Aad van Wijngaarden op het proefschrift: Formal Description of Programming Languages: with an application to the definition of ALGOL 60. Al sinds 1964 was hij als wetenschappelijk medewerker werkzaam op het toenmalige Mathematisch Centrum (MC) te Amsterdam (vanaf 1984 het Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica). Hij was vervolgens hoofd van de afdeling informatica, gaf leiding aan het Cluster Software Engineering en was sinds 2002 CWI Fellow. In 1973 werd hij daarnaast hoogleraar informatica aan de Vrije Universiteit, waar hij in 2002 met emeritaat ging.

Als informaticus hield De Bakker zich met name bezig met de mathematische semantiek van programmeertalen (op dit gebied gold hij als een pionier) en de bewijstheorie (correctheid van het programmeren). Hij was in 1972 een van de grondleggers van de European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), waarvan hij van 1972 tot 1982 vice-voorzitter was en tot 1988 lid van het bestuur.

After taking positions at the Eindhoven University of Technology (where he became Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science) and the Georgia Institute of Technology, he returned to CWI as its director in 2003. He stepped down in 2011, and at that time became a CWI Fellow.

Hendrik Willem Lenstra Jr. (born 16 April 1949, Zaandam) is a Dutch mathematician. Lenstra received his doctorate from the University of Amsterdam in 1977 and became a professor there in 1978. In 1987 he was appointed to the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley; starting in 1998, he divided his time between Berkeley and the University of Leiden, until 2003, when he retired from Berkeley to take a full-time position at Leiden.

Lenstra has worked principally in computational number theory. He is well known for:
- Co-discovering of the [Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra%E2%80%93Lenstra%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_lattice_basis_reduction_algorithm) (in 1982);
- Developing an polynomial-time algorithm for solving a feasibility Integer programming problem when the number of variables is fixed (in 1983);
- Discovering the [elliptic curve factorization method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra_elliptic-curve_factorization) (in 1987);
- Computing all solutions to the [inverse Fermat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem#Inverse_Fermat_equation) (in 1992);
- The [Cohen–Lenstra heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_number_problem#Real_quadratic_fields) - a set of precise conjectures about the structure of class groups of quadratic fields.

## Jan Bergstra
<img src="bergstra.jpg" style="width:20%;padding:10px;float:left;display:block"></img>
from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Bergstra): Johannes Aldert "Jan" Bergstra (born 1951) is a Dutch computer scientist. His work has focussed on logic and the theoretical foundations of software engineering, especially on formal methods for system design. He is best known as an expert on algebraic methods for the specification of data and computational processes in general.

Bergstra held posts at the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Leiden (1976–82), and the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam. In 1985 he was appointed Professor of Programming and Software Engineering at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam and, at the same time, Professor of Applied Logic at Utrecht University; such split positions are not uncommon in the Netherlands. These two chairs he continues to hold.

## David Chaum
from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum):
<img src="chaum.jpg" style="width:20%;padding:10px;float:left;display:block"></img>
David Chaum (born 1955) is an American computer scientist and cryptographer. He is known as a pioneer in cryptography and privacy-preserving technologies, and widely recognized as the inventor of digital cash. His 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups" is the first known proposal for a blockchain protocol. Complete with the code to implement the protocol, Chaum's dissertation proposed all but one element of the blockchain later detailed in the Bitcoin whitepaper.

He is also known for developing ecash, an electronic cash application that aims to preserve a user's anonymity, and inventing many cryptographic protocols like the blind signature, mix networks and the Dining cryptographers protocol. In 1995 his company DigiCash created the first digital currency with eCash. His 1981 paper, "Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms", laid the groundwork for the field of anonymous communications research.

In the early 80s, Chaum sets up the [CWI Cryptology research group](https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/cryptology).

## Krysztof Apt
From the 2010 biographical note [Krzysztof Apt](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~apt/)'s homepage:
<img src="apt.jpg" style="width:20%;padding:10px;float:left;display:block"></img>
Currently, the main interest of Apt is game theory and mechanism design. These are two areas of theoretical economics but in the advent of internet economics they are nowadays also of relevance for computer science. "It is fascinating to see how quickly the borders between computer science and economics melt. Some articles can now be submitted either to a conference on Artificial Intelligence or electronic commerce, or to an economic journal. And some, like our recent work on distributed mechanism design, draw on ideas from both disciplines."

Apt is still interested in two areas of research in computer science in which he has been involved in the past twenty five years, namely program verification and constraint programming.
