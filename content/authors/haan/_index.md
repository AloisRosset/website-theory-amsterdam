My research interests include the application of methods from theoretical computer science—in particular methods from (parameterized) complexity theory—to problems in artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge representation & reasoning (KRR), and computational logic.

Generally, I'm fascinated by all things related to computational complexity—e.g., parameterized complexity theory, the Polynomial Hierarchy (PH), subexponential-time complexity, the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), and (parameterized) compilability.

I wrote my PhD thesis—titled "Parameterized Complexity in the Polynomial Hierarchy"—at the Algorithms and Complexity Group at the Faculty of Informatics of the Technische Universität Wien. I received my PhD in 2016. My PhD thesis was awarded the E.W. Beth Dissertation Prize 2017, was shortlisted for the Heinz Zemanek Prize 2018, and was nominated for the GI-Dissertationspreis 2016 of the German Informatics Society.

I have an Erdős number of 3.
