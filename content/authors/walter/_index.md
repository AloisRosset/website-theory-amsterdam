From 2017 to 2021, I was Assistant Professor in Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Amsterdam (KdVI, ITFA, ILLC) and QuSoft. Since 2022, I am full professor at Ruhr Universität Bochum, and guest professor at UvA.

My research is in quantum information and its interplay with mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. Motivated by quantum information, I study mathematical problems in optimization, representation theory, and invariant theory through the lens of computation. I was supported in part by an NWO Veni grant on Quantum bits in space and time and by an NWO KLEIN grant on Taming tensors: an optimization approach to computational invariant theory. I was part of the NWA quantum/nano route and a member of the Geometry and Quantum Theory and DIAMANT mathematical research clusters.
