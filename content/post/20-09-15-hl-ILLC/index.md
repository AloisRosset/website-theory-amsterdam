Do you have the ambition to develop world class research in Theoretical Computer Science at the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation? Do you have the drive to forma strong and visible nucleus Theoretical Computer Science in our University together with the other new chair Theoretical Computer Science at the Informatics Institute? Are you interested to work in a thriving interdisciplinary environment in which you can build up and lead a new research group, establish connections to different research lines in the ILLC, teach theoretical computer science in our bachelor/master programmes, and carry out managerial tasks in research and education?

We offer a position of full professor in Theoretical Computer Science at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam. The area of theoretical computer science comprises a broad variety of topics or subfields, including (but not restricted to) algorithms and computational complexity, program semantics and verification, logic and computation, machine models and automata, information theory, machine learning, and the foundations of artificial intelligence. You are a leading researcher in one of these areas, has a profound knowledge of the wider area of theoretical computer science, and will be expected to make connections with other research lines in the ILLC, in particular those in logic, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics and quantum computing.

The Institute for Logic, Language and Computation is an interdisciplinary research institute that is part of both the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Amsterdam. Its scientific mission is to study the formal properties of information, viz. the fundamental structure and properties of processes of encoding, transmitting and comprehending information. Within the ILLC, the new chair naturally fits within the scope of the ‘Logic and Computation’ programme, where it will complement the research group on quantum computing. This programme also houses strong groups in logic and in artificial intelligence, both of which offer rich potential for synergy effects with the area served by the new chair. Other outstanding research lines of interest in the institute are the ones on computational linguistics and cognition.

ILLC staff members teach in various undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Relevant for the chair in theoretical computer science are the BSc programmes in Computer Science and AI, and the MSc programmes in Logic, AI and Computer Science.

This chair in theoretical computer science at the ILLC will be hosted within the Faculty of Science. Within the Faculty, the information sciences are organized in two research institutes, the Informatics Institute and the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation. Note that the Informatics Institute is currently also establishing a new chair in Theoretical Computer Science. Both chair holders are expected to strengthen links and further build a visible nucleus of Theoretical Computer science in Amsterdam, together with colleagues at VU (Vrije Universiteit) and CWI (Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica, the national research institute for mathematics and computer science).

## What are you going to do?
You are expected to
- develop an independent line of world-class research in theoretical computer science  and publish results in internationally leading venues;
- build up and lead a research group that includes PhD students and postdoctoral researchers and foster collaboration with other groups within the ILLC and the Informatics Institute;
- initiate and contribute to proposals for raising substantial external research funding;
- design and teach undergraduate and postgraduate courses in various education programmes, supervise student projects and BSc and MSc theses;
- take responsibility for relevant parts of these education programmes
- create and exploit opportunities for applied research collaborations with industrial and governmental institutional partners and actively contribute to the dissemination of research results to industry and society;
- take responsibility for higher administrative tasks in research and education at the institute and faculty, possibly as director of the institute;
- play a leading role in various organizations in the field of theoretical computer science;
- help build a strong and visible nucleus of Theoretical Computer science in Amsterdam.

## What do we require of you?
You are a scientist of international standing and meet the following requirements:
- a PhD in Computer Science or a related discipline;
- a profound knowledge of the field of theoretical computer science and its connections with other areas such as logic and AI;
- an excellent publication record;
- an extensive international network of research contacts;
- a proven track record of attracting research funding from a variety of sources;
- the ability to communicate research findings to a broad audience;
- excellent didactic skills and demonstrated dedication to and experience with university teaching at all levels, can give direction in the organization of education in the information sciences;
- experience in stimulating and supervising students and junior researchers;
- interest in contributing to an interdisciplinary research environment;
- willingness to engage in valorisation and outreach activities;
- excellent leadership capabilities, such as providing direction, and inspiring employees;
- willingness and proven ability to perform administrative, organizational and managerial tasks in both research and education.

## Our offer
An employment contract for 38 hours a week, preferably starting on 1 January 2021.

The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be €5,749 to €8,371 (scale H2) gross per month, based on a full-time contract (38 hours a week). These amounts are exclusive 8 % holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.
