I'm a PhD candidate at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by Ronald de Haan.

The general scope of my research is knowledge representation and reasoning. I am very interested in how this field is related with multiagent systems, evidence, uncertainty, computational complexity and modal logic.
