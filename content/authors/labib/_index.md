Farrokh obtained a bachelor degree in both mathematics and physics and a master degree in mathematical physics at the University of Amsterdam. His past research focused on the tautological ring of the moduli space of curves. He started his PhD in August of 2017 at CWI, where he is advised by Dr. Jop BriÃ«t, and hopes to contribute to the field of quantum information science.
